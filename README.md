# Stroke-o-Scope

This is a neural network that tries its best to predict strokes.

## Quick summary

This is my first shot at implementing a neural network by myself using pyTorch. I'm using matplolib for plotting, pandas for importing the dataset and sklearn for data splitting. The model averages a 75% of correct predictions. This could be caused because the dataset has way more instances of "no strokes" than "strokes".

## Set up

This project has been developed in Google Colab, you will only need to upload the files to your Google Colab and test it.
